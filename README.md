Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
The term "software engineering" was coined at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference in Garmisch, Germany. This conference recognized software development as a distinct engineering discipline, separate from computer science and mathematics. It marked the beginning of software engineering as a field of study, acknowledging the need for a systematic approach to software development.

The Waterfall Model and Structured Programming (1970s)
In the 1970s, the Waterfall model was introduced by Winston Royce, and structured programming was developed by Edsger Dijkstra, among others. The Waterfall model provided a linear, phase-by-phase approach to software development, while structured programming emphasized modular, top-down design. These innovations brought discipline and organization to software development, improving the quality and reliability of software products.

Agile Methodologies and DevOps (2000s)
The Agile Manifesto (2001) and the rise of DevOps (2009) revolutionized software engineering by emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and rapid delivery. Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban focused on iterative development, customer satisfaction, and team empowerment. DevOps integrated development and operations teams, streamlining the software development lifecycle and enabling continuous integration, testing, and deployment. These movements transformed software engineering, enabling faster time-to-market, improved quality, and increased customer satisfaction.

These milestones represent significant shifts in the evolution of software engineering, from its recognition as a distinct discipline to the adoption of structured approaches, and finally, to the emphasis on agility, collaboration, and rapid delivery.
